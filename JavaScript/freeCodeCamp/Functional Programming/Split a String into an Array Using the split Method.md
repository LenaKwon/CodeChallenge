# Split a String into an Array Using the split Method
The `split` method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the `delimiter`, 
which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. 
For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.

Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:
```javascript
const str = "Hello World";
const bySpace = str.split(" ");

const otherString = "How9are7you2today";
const byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);
```
`bySpace` would have the value `["Hello", "World"]` and `byDigits` would have the value `["How", "are", "you", "today"]`.

Since strings are immutable, the split method makes it easier to work with them.

Use the split method inside the splitify function to split `str` into an array of words. The function should return the array. 
Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.

## Before
```javascript
function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}

splitify("Hello World,I-am code");
```
## Answers
```javascript
function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return str.split(\W)
  // Only change code above this line
}

splitify("Hello World,I-am code");
```
## Thinking
`/\W/` Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores.</br> 
Itâ€™s equivalent to `/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/`. For more information about Regular Expressions, see the official [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
